# Diversity Simulation
Alamouti code and MRRC simulation in Rayleigh fading channel using MATLAB

diversity_sim.m is used to plot the BER of Alamouti code and MRRC in Rayleigh fading channel. Using BPSK and ML decoding criterion.

channel_plot.m is used to plot the Rayleigh fading channel's channel impulse response.

BER curve is in BER_fig
