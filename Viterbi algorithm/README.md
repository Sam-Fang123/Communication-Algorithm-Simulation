# Convolution Code using Viterbi Algorithm

There are C code verison where encoder_218.c is the encoder of (2,1,8) convolution code .

And decoder_218.c is the decoder of (2,1,8) convolution code using Viterbi algo.

And the .txt file is using to test decoder_218.c to detect the error position.

There are also some simulation of BER of Viterbi algorithm in the file /ber_sim.

Compare the (2,1,8) code and (3,1,8) code.

The result are in /ber_sim/result
