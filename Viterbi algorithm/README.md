# Convolution Code using Viterbi Algorithm

There are C code verison where encoder_218.c is the encoder of (2,1,8) convolution code .

And decoder_218.c is the decoder of (2,1,8) convolution code using Viterbi algo.

And the .txt file is using to test decoder_218.c to detect the error position.

There are also some MATLAB verison of convolution code in matlab_sim.

There are different verison convolution code, also have soft decision verison.

Viterbi_algo_sim.m is used to simulate all of them and plot the BER.
