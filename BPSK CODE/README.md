# BPSK Simulation
BPSK_BER_equal_P.m plot the BER of BPSK, assume equal hypothesis, using ML decoding criterion.

BPSK_BER_non_equal.m plot the BER of BPSK, assume non-equal hypothesis, using MAP decoding criterion.

Bits_Histogram.m plot the  histograms of BPSK, assume equal hypothesis in differemt SNR.

Some results are in /result_figure
