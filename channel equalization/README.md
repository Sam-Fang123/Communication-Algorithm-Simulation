# Channel-Equalization-Simulation
Channel equalization simulation using MATLAB.

Wiener_filterv2.m is used to simulation Wiener filter in fixed SNR.

Wiener_bpsk.m is used to plot BER of Wiener filter in different SNR.

LMS_sim.m is used to simulation LMS in fixed SNR.

LMS_bpsk_v2.m is used to plot BER of LMS in different SNR.

Zero_forcing_bpsk.m is used to plot BER of zero forcing in different SNR.

The result of LMS and Wiener filter and zero forcing is in channel equalization report.pptx.

The BER curve is in BER_curve_fig.
