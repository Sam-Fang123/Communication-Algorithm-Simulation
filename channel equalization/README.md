# Channel-Equalization-Simulation
Channel equalization simulation using MATLAB.

Wiener_filterv2.m is used to simulation Wiener filter in fixed SNR.

Wiener_bpsk.m is used to plot BER of Wiener filter.

LMS_sim.m is used to simulation LMS in fixed SNR.

LMS_bpsk_v2.m is used to plot BER of LMS.

Steepest_desenct.m is used to simulate steepest desenct.

The reslut of LMS and Wiener filter is in channel equalization report.pptx.

The result of steepest descent is in asp_HW.
